# WeNDEYSS: Weightless Network Designed To Eventually Yield       #
#          Sentience and Sapience                                 #
#                                                                 #
# Bitwise-based variant of NDEYSS, Python Implementation.         #
# In spite of its name, not a weightless neural network; it's     #
# called such in response to the way a certain learning           #
# Algorithm within a certain video game seemed to had worked      #
# At first glance.                                                #
#                                                                 #
# This learning algorithm is essentially a clean-house            #
# re-implementation of the one from that game.                    #

# Just don't think about things too hard;
# you'd just get headaches from doing that.
